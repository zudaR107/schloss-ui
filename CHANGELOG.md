# Changelog

Brief log of notable changes, grouped by theme — not a full commit history
(see `git log` for that). New entries get appended under the section they
fit best; add a new section if none fits.

## Setup
- Initial repo: README, LICENSE (AGPL-3.0), CONTRIBUTING.md, community
  health files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, issue/PR templates).
- Package skeleton: `package.json` (`@zudar107/schloss-ui`, published to
  GitHub Packages), TypeScript config mirroring the other repos'
  strictness, tsup as the bundler (ESM + `.d.ts`), vitest +
  Testing Library for tests, oxlint for linting. CI runs lint/typecheck/
  test/build on every push and PR; a tag-triggered `publish.yml` builds
  and publishes on any `v*` tag, after checking the tag matches
  `package.json`'s version.
